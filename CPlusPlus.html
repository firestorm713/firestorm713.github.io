        <h3> Legend of Zelda Prototype[WIP]</h3>
        Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was the first game I ever picked up. I've beaten it dozens of times, broken it using a special bug, and I still know most of the secrets, even though it's been years. This is a test level with the basic elements of a game in the same vein as the Legend of Zelda games.
        <h3> Procedural Level Generation[WIP]</h3>
        Since minecraft came out, Procedural Generation has been a fascination of mine. This is a further implementation of the above prototype, with the intention of creating Legend of Zelda style levels.
        <h3> Prototype Game Engine and Toolset[WIP]</h3>
        At a small school, you have to make do with what you have. What we had is a single Computer Graphics course, and a single video game design course. I decided to meet with my advisor and the department head to extend my education in my two favorite fields as an independent study. This is the result of that study(source)
        <h3> Prototype Marching Cubes Terrain[WIP]</h3>
        This was the game implemented with the above engine. It leverage experience I gained working with Marching Squares in Unity3D, as well as the architecture set forth by the above engine. It uses the same Ocean Simulation for the water, and Marching Cubes for the terrain.
