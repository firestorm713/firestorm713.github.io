<h3>Experience</h3><h4>Programmer, Synaptic Switch</h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Grand Junction, CO -- 2014 -</span><br>At
Synaptic Switch, I was part of a team tasked with creating
Intergalactic Looby, an endless runner. On my team, I was the Unity
Expert, having worked with Unity almost since Freshman Year. I was also
in charge of implementing two primary mechanics, flying and jumping.<br><br><br>
<h4>Tutor and Lab Assistant, Colorado Mesa University</h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Grand Junction, CO -- 2012 -</span>
<br>As part of being in the student chapter of the Association of Computing
Machinery, we were given the opportunity to become tutors for the
Computer Science department. We were to be available for 1-2 hours a
day to answer questions, help with homework, and teach concepts
students didn't understand.<br><br>
<h4>Consultation Agent, Best Buy Geek Squad</h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Grand Junction, CO -- 2013</span>
<br>As a consultation agent, it was my job to be the intermediary between the
clients and repair team. I had to be able to interpret what the client
was telling me was wrong, or asking me to do, document what they said,
reproduce their issue, and document any further issues I found. After
this, I scheduled the proper repair operations with the repair team. We
were also in charge of tablets and phone repairs, as well as issuing
warranty replacements when applicable.<br><br><h3>Education</h3><h4>Colorado Mesa University</h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Computer Science -- 2009-2015</span>
<br>I am currently the President of our student chapter of the Association
for Computing Machinery. I spend a lot of my free time on ACM business,
such as scheduling events, this could be anywhere from the Monthly Math
and Science night, the bi-weekly student meetings, scheduling practice
meetings for the Collegiate Programing Competition, and setting up our
station for the annual Math Extravaganza. I enjoy programming as much
as I ever enjoyed gaming. Often, I get more of a rush from figuring out
a difficult algorithm than I do from beating a difficult boss in Dark
Souls. What time I don't spend on ACM, Programming, teaching myself
concepts, or making games, I spend on one of my myriad hobbies:
learning to compose music, writing, and reading a lot of books,
generally sci fi and fantasy, or textbooks.<br><br>
