        <h3>Skills & Abilities</h3>
            <h4>MAJOR PROJECTS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Echo VR (2018-) - Zero-G ultimate frisbee and Zero-G Shooter.</li>
                    <li>DeFormers Tencent (2017-2018) - Physics-Based Battle Game. Most elements of game needed to be revamped for localization, from main menu, to HUD. </li>
                    <li>Embers of War(2016-2017) - Tower Defense game in Unreal Engine 4. I collaborated very closely with design to create most UI systems, as there wasn't a dedicated UI Designer.</li>
                    <li>CV Baseball (2015-2016) - First professional job. My initial job was to implement a way to import card data, and to implement matchmaking, but my role has expanded to include gameplay, UI animation and programming (from artist mockup), and all multiplayer.</li>
                    <li>Firestorm Engine (2015) - Game Engine Architecture project for Independent Study. Studied game engines, and reproduced a very basic game engine with the purposes of understanding how engines are put together, and building an understandable example for students and programmers wanting to get into game development.</li>
                    <li>Ocean Simulation (2014) - Computer Graphics project. Built on the work of Jerry Tessendorf. Implemented in Unity</li>
                    <li>Intergalactic Looby (2014) - Project for my Software Engineering class. We were tasked with finding a client and making a product for them. There was a small mobile game studio that we know, who asked us to work on a project they didnâ€™t have time for. See job entry below for what I specifically worked on.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>TECHNICAL</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual Technologies - OpenGL, SDL, SFML, XNA/Monogame, Unity3D, Unreal Engine</li>
                    <li>Languages - C++, C#, Java, Python</li>
                    <li>General Skill Areas - Procedural Generation, Computer Graphics, Simulation, Engine Architecture, Artificial Intelligence</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>COMMUNICATION</h4>
                <ul>
